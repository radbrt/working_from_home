# You can't work from home

Short attempt at estimating relative probability of working from home, based on mentions of "hjemmekontor" in job ads.

Naturally, not all ads mention this as a perk, but in lieu of better information we'll stipulate that for a given occupation with WFH possibility, there is a given probability that a random employer will mention it as a perk.
